## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** Bank executive with worried expression, newspaper headlines about greenwashing fines

### The $1.5 Trillion Greenwashing Crisis

**Current Reality:**
- Banks issue $1.5T+ in sustainability-linked loans annually
- 100% rely on **unverified** borrower self-reporting
- Greenwashing fines exceed $500M/year and rising
- SFDR Level 2 compliance deadline: Q1 2026 (NOW)
- Manual verification costs $50,000+ per loan annually

### The Problem
> **"Banks are flying blind on $1.5 trillion of ESG exposure."**

**Every lender MUST verify ESG claims by 2026. Current manual processes cannot scale.**

## PRESENTATION NOTES FOR PRESENTER

**Timing:** 3-5 minutes for core deck (Slides 1-15)

**Key Messages:**
1. **Problem is real and urgent** - SFDR deadline is NOW
2. **Solution is differentiated** - Only automated multi-source platform
3. **Market is massive** - $5B+ TAM with regulatory forcing function
4. **Traction is real** - Working prototype in 48 hours
5. **Team can execute** - Domain expertise + technical skills

**Delivery Tips:**
- Start with the greenwashing crisis - judges feel this pain
- Show the live demo - don't just describe it
- Emphasize "automated" and "real-time" - key differentiators
- Connect every feature to business value
- End with urgency - SFDR deadline creates buying pressure

**Questions to Anticipate:**
- "What about existing ESG rating agencies?" → We're loan-specific and real-time, they're backwards-looking
- "How do you access utility data?" → APIs, borrower consent, IoT integrations
- "What's your moat?" → First-mover + data network effects + integration complexity
- "Who's your first customer?" → In conversations with [name if possible]
